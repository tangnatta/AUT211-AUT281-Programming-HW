# Practice: On Tinker CAD
1. Make the circuit of the figure.
2. Write the Program.
3. Run the simulation and watch the value on Serial
Monitor.
4. Record the values when temperature were 125℃ and
-40℃.
• Temperature sensors provide a voltage output that is linearly
proportional to the Celsius (centigrade) temperature.
5. Complete the equation (A) underlined.
6. Run the simulation again and watch the values on
Serial Monitor.
7. Copy the circuit and program to the report.
